<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Emily. I am a 26 year old tech enthusiast from central New Jersey.</p>

<p>I have my BA from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 3D Computer Animation 
  and I am currently teaching myself how to code. Growing up, I would always 
  draw and make little flip books. I have always been mesmorized by all forms of 
  animation and art. While I study different coding languages, I like to take breaks
by making custom mugs, cups, and stickers.</p>

<p>I currently work at Best Buy where I've been for around 4 years. Starting as a customer
  service specialist, I was quickly moved to the sales floor due to my knowledge of the
  newest technology. I was a computer sales associate for about one year before moving to the
  warehouse. This move was due to the pandemic closing the stores to the public. I made it a 
  point to continue working throughout the pandemic so that I can have a steady income and to 
  learn more about the internal systems used in the warehouse. Once I learned more about the 
  internal systems, I was quickly promoted to the inventory control specialist. This put me in
  charge of inventory and theft control. I conducted daily stock counts in order to find any trends
  in loss of inventory. After two and a half years, I felt that I learned all that I could so I set 
  my sites on Geek Squad. At Geek Squad, I diagnose and repair client devices. Whether it be replacing
  hard drives, conducting in-depth malware/virus scans, or simply helping a client change a password, 
  I enjoy being able to help those who need it.
