<h3>Troll 2</h3>
<p>It is so bad that it is good. It also reminds me of the movie nights with friends freshmen year of college. </p>
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>A cinematically beautiful film about love and lost. I found this movie at a vulnerable point in my life and it means a lot.</p>
<h3>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>
